# Unforgotten
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 24th 2021


## Theme 
The theme is Every Death Counts

* Our interpretation of this theme comes from an Idea Xander had regarding a soldier reuniting with his comrade's graves in a cemetery. 
* This idea of life and death, intertwined with one another is a way we think explores the theme. 

## Game Play
**Objective**
* Survive
* Find the key at the end of each level

**Game-play instructions**
* Maneuver through three unique dead world levels, each representing the purgatory of a fallen comrade
* Survive the ghostly spectors by avoidance or traping them with your own tombstone
* Find the key opening a portal to the next level


## Impediments
**Robertson, Jacob**
* For me, it was making the tilesheet. It was not as intuitive as I remember it being in the lesson.

**Kaliczak, Alexander**
* Working in a team environment rather then on your own was a new and rewarding experience.
