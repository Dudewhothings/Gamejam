# Unforgotten
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 24th 2021


## Theme 
The theme is Every Death Counts

* Our interpretation of this theme comes from an Idea Xander had regarding a soldier reuniting with his comrade's graves in a cemetery. 
* This idea of life and death, intertwined with one another is a way we think explores the theme.
